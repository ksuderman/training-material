# Object Storage

Galaxy can already make use of Cloud storage:
- Amazon S3
- Openstack Swift
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure (experimental)
- Dropbox, etc.

???

- All of the major cloud vendors provide their own native object storage solutions.
- However, taking full advantage of their features requires coding to their own APIs.

# Container Attached Storage

- Microservice based storage controllers managed by Kubernetes.
- Advantages
  1. Agility
  1. Granularity
  1. Avoid lock-in
- CAS be thought of as a design pattern.

???

- With Container Attached Storage the storage itself is abstracted as a microservice that runs in containers.
- To developers Container Attached Storage looks like direct or network attached storage, but has several benefits.
- Agility. Each volume has a containerized controller and containerized replicas that Kubernetes can manages just like other resources.
- Granularity. Storage policies can be configured on a per-volume basis and updated dynamically to achieve the desired result for each workload
- Avoiding cloud vendor lock in by avoiding vendor specific solutions.
- Storage controllers are able to migrate data in the background and workloads can be moved to other clusters with minimal disruption for users.
- However, every product that provides Container Attached Storage does it slightly differently with different features and benefits.
